        <p><strong>Shaped like the hives of the wild bees domesticated in<br>
            Eversong Woods, this blood elven bread does not<br>
            disappoint. Enjoy it with jam or more honey—because you<br>
            can't have too much honey.</strong></p>

    <ul class=" outline">
        <li><em>1/4 cup warm water</em></li>
        <li><em>3/4 cup rolled oats</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 cup milk, warmed</em></li>
        <li><em>2 tablespoons butter, melted</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 cup honey</em></li>
        <li><em>2 teaspoons instant dry yeast</em></li>
        <li><em>1 1/2teaspoons salt</em></li>
        <li><em>1 egg</em></li>
        <li><em>Up to 3 cups flour</em></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="center">
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Combine the warm water and oats in a large bowl,</strong> letting them sit for<br>
            five minutes to soak. Add the milk, honey, yeast, salt, and one tablespoon<br>
            of the melted butter to the bowl. Beat in the egg, and then gradually mix in<br>
            the flour, one cup at a time—you may not need all of it—until you have a<br>
            nice, workable dough that isn't too sticky. Turn it out onto a lightly<br>
            floured surface and knead for several minutes until the dough bounces<br>
            back when poked. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and set in a<br>
            warm place to rise for about an hour, or until doubled in size.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Butter the outside of a small mixing bowl roughly 8 inches wide and 6<br>
            inches tall.</strong> Set upside down on a baking sheet. Divide the dough into four<br>
            equal parts. Roll these pieces of dough out into ropes, each about 3 feet<br>
            long. Beginning at the top of the overturned bowl, coil one rope around<br>
            itself, working your way outward and down the bowl. When you reach the<br>
            end of the first piece, pinch another length of dough onto the end and<br>
            continue coiling, forming a beehive shape. It's fine if the dough doesn't<br>
            reach all the way to the baking sheet when you are done—it will expand as<br>
            it rises. Cover the dough lightly and allow to rise again for about half the<br>
            time as before.</p></li>

        <li><p><strong>Preheat the oven to 350°F,</strong> and once the bread has risen again, move the<br>
            baking sheet to the oven and bake for around 20 minutes, or until the<br>
            outside of the bread is a light golden color. Brush with the remaining<br>
            tablespoon of melted butter, and allow to cool before gently lifting the<br>
            bread off the bowl.</p></li>
